# Agent Playbook

## Mental Model

Each session is a fresh execution in a shared workshop. Work
continuity comes from artifacts left on the bench. Follow the
cycle: **Work → Reflect → Persist**. After completing a task,
making a decision, learning something, or hitting a milestone —
persist before continuing. Don't wait for session end; it may
never come cleanly.

## Invoking ctx

Always use `ctx` from PATH:
```bash
ctx status        # ✓ correct
ctx agent         # ✓ correct
./dist/ctx        # ✗ avoid hardcoded paths
go run ./cmd/ctx  # ✗ avoid unless developing ctx itself
```

Check with `which ctx` if unsure whether it's installed.

## Context Readback

Before starting any work, read the required context files and confirm to the
user: "I have read the required context files and I'm following project
conventions." Do not begin implementation until you have done so.

## Reason Before Acting

Before implementing any non-trivial change, think through it step-by-step:

1. **Decompose**: break the problem into smaller parts
2. **Identify impact**: what files, tests, and behaviors does this touch?
3. **Anticipate failure**: what could go wrong? What are the edge cases?
4. **Sequence**: what order minimizes risk and maximizes checkpoints?

This applies to debugging too — reason through the cause before reaching
for a fix. Rushing to code before reasoning is the most common source of
wasted work.

### Chunk and Checkpoint Large Tasks

For work spanning many files or steps, break it into independently
verifiable chunks. After each chunk:

1. **Commit** — save progress to git so nothing is lost
2. **Persist** — record learnings or decisions discovered during the chunk
3. **Verify** — run tests or `make lint` before moving on

Track progress via TASKS.md checkboxes. If context runs low mid-task,
persist a progress note (what's done, what's next, what assumptions
remain) before continuing in a new window. The `check-context-size`
hook warns at 80% usage — treat that as a signal to checkpoint, not
to rush.

## Session Lifecycle

A session follows this arc:

**Load → Orient → Pick → Work → Commit → Reflect**

Not every session uses every step — a quick bugfix skips reflection, a
research session skips committing — but the full flow is:

<!-- drift-check: ls internal/assets/claude/skills/ctx-remember internal/assets/claude/skills/ctx-status internal/assets/claude/skills/ctx-next internal/assets/claude/skills/ctx-implement internal/assets/claude/skills/ctx-commit internal/assets/claude/skills/ctx-reflect 2>&1 | grep -c skills/ -->
| Step        | What Happens                                       | Skill / Command  |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| **Load**    | Recall context, present structured readback        | `/ctx-remember`  |
| **Orient**  | Check context health, surface issues               | `/ctx-status`    |
| **Pick**    | Choose what to work on                             | `/ctx-next`      |
| **Work**    | Write code, fix bugs, research                     | `/ctx-implement` |
| **Commit**  | Commit with context capture                        | `/ctx-commit`    |
| **Reflect** | Surface persist-worthy items from this session     | `/ctx-reflect`   |

### Context Health at Session Start

During **Load** and **Orient**, run `ctx status` and read the output.
Surface problems worth mentioning:

- **High completion ratio in TASKS.md**: offer to archive
- **Stale context files** (not modified recently): mention before
  stale context influences work
- **Bloated token count** (over 30k): offer `ctx compact`
- **Drift between files and code**: spot-check paths from
  ARCHITECTURE.md against the actual file tree

One sentence is enough — don't turn startup into a maintenance session.

### Context Window Limits

The `check-context-size` hook (`ctx system check-context-size`) monitors
context window usage and warns when it exceeds 80%. When you see this
warning or sense context is running long:

- **Persist progress**: write what's done and what's left to TASKS.md
  or a progress note
- **Checkpoint state**: commit work-in-progress so a fresh session can
  pick up cleanly
- **Summarize**: leave a breadcrumb for the next window — the current
  task, open questions, and next step

Context compaction happens automatically, but the next window loses
nuance. Explicit persistence is cheaper than re-discovery.

### Conversational Triggers

Users rarely invoke skills explicitly. Recognize natural language:

<!-- drift-check: ls internal/assets/claude/skills/ctx-remember internal/assets/claude/skills/ctx-status internal/assets/claude/skills/ctx-next internal/assets/claude/skills/ctx-commit internal/assets/claude/skills/ctx-reflect internal/assets/claude/skills/ctx-add-decision internal/assets/claude/skills/ctx-add-learning internal/assets/claude/skills/ctx-add-convention internal/assets/claude/skills/ctx-add-task 2>&1 | grep -c skills/ -->
| User Says                                       | Action                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| "Do you remember?" / "What were we working on?" | `/ctx-remember`                                        |
| "How's our context looking?"                    | `/ctx-status`                                          |
| "What should we work on?"                       | `/ctx-next`                                            |
| "Commit this" / "Ship it"                       | `/ctx-commit`                                          |
| "The rate limiter is done" / "We finished that" | `ctx complete` (match to TASKS.md)                     |
| "What did we learn?"                            | `/ctx-reflect`                                         |
| "Save that as a decision"                       | `/ctx-add-decision`                                    |
| "That's worth remembering" / "Any gotchas?"     | `/ctx-add-learning`                                    |
| "Record that convention"                        | `/ctx-add-convention`                                  |
| "Add a task for that"                           | `/ctx-add-task`                                        |
| "Sync memory" / "What's in auto memory?"        | `ctx memory sync` / `ctx memory status`                |
| "Import from memory"                            | `ctx memory import --dry-run` then `ctx memory import` |
| "Let's wrap up"                                 | Reflect → persist outstanding items → present together |

## Proactive Persistence

**Don't wait to be asked.** Identify persist-worthy moments in real time:

| Event                                      | Action                                                            |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Completed a task                           | Mark done in TASKS.md, offer to add learnings                     |
| Chose between design alternatives          | Offer: *"Worth recording as a decision?"*                         |
| Hit a subtle bug or gotcha                 | Offer: *"Want me to add this as a learning?"*                     |
| Finished a feature or fix                  | Identify follow-up work, offer to add as tasks                    |
| Resolved a tricky debugging session        | Capture root cause before moving on                               |
| Multi-step task or feature complete        | Suggest reflection: *"Want me to capture what we learned?"*       |
| Session winding down                       | Offer: *"Want me to capture outstanding learnings or decisions?"* |
| Shipped a feature or closed batch of tasks | Offer blog post or journal site rebuild                           |

**Self-check**: periodically ask yourself — *"If this session ended
right now, would the next session know what happened?"* If no, persist
something before continuing.

Offer once and respect "no." Default to surfacing the opportunity
rather than letting it pass silently.

## Collaboration Defaults

Standing behavioral defaults for how the agent collaborates with the
user. These apply unless the user overrides them for the session
(e.g., "skip the alternatives, just build it").

- **At design decisions**: always present 2+ approaches with
  trade-offs before committing — don't silently pick one
- **At completion claims**: run `/ctx-verify` — it maps claims to
  evidence (e.g., "tests pass" requires 0-failure output, "build
  succeeds" requires exit 0). At minimum, answer the self-audit
  questions: What did I assume? What didn't I check? Where am I
  least confident? What would a reviewer question?
- **At ambiguous moments**: ask the user rather than inferring
  intent — a quick question is cheaper than rework
- **When producing artifacts**: flag assumptions and uncertainty
  areas inline, not buried in a footnote

These follow the same pattern as proactive persistence: offer once
and respect "no."

## Own the Whole Branch

When working on a branch, you own every issue on it — lint failures, test
failures, build errors — regardless of who introduced them. Never dismiss
a problem as "pre-existing" or "not related to my changes."

- **If `make lint` fails, fix it.** The branch must be green when you're done.
- **If tests break, investigate.** Even if the failing test is in a file you
  didn't touch, something you changed may have caused it — or it may have been
  broken before and it's still your job to fix it on this branch.
- **Run the full validation suite** (`make lint`, `go test ./...`, `go build`)
  before declaring any phase complete.

## How to Avoid Hallucinating Memory

Never assume. If you don't see it in files, you don't know it.

- Don't claim "we discussed X" without file evidence
- Don't invent history — check context files and `ctx recall`
- If uncertain, say "I don't see this documented"
- Trust files over intuition

## Planning Non-Trivial Work

Before implementing a feature or multi-task effort, follow this sequence:

**1. Spec first** — Write a design document in `specs/` covering: problem,
solution, storage, CLI surface, error cases, and non-goals. Keep it concise
but complete enough that another session could implement from it alone.

**2. Task it out** — Break the work into individual tasks in TASKS.md under
a dedicated Phase section. Each task should be independently completable and
verifiable.

**3. Cross-reference** — The Phase header in TASKS.md must reference the
spec: `Spec: \`specs/feature-name.md\``. The first task in the phase should
include: "Read `specs/feature-name.md` before starting any PX task."

**4. Read before building** — When picking up a task that references a spec,
read the spec first. Don't rely on the task description alone — it's a
summary, not the full design.

## When to Consolidate vs Add Features

**Signs you should consolidate first:**
- Same string literal appears in 3+ files
- Hardcoded paths use string concatenation
- Test file is growing into a monolith (>500 lines)
- Package name doesn't match folder name

When in doubt, ask: "Would a new contributor understand where this belongs?"

## Pre-Flight Checklist: CLI Code

Before writing or modifying CLI code (`internal/cli/**/*.go`):

1. **Read CONVENTIONS.md** — load established patterns into context
2. **Check similar commands** — how do existing commands handle output?
3. **Use cmd methods for output** — `cmd.Printf`, `cmd.Println`,
   not `fmt.Printf`, `fmt.Println`
4. **Follow docstring format** — see CONVENTIONS.md, Documentation section
