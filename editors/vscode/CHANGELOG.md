# Changelog

All notable changes to the **ctx: Persistent Context for AI** extension
will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [0.9.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- **@ctx chat participant** with 45 slash commands covering context
  lifecycle, task management, session recall, and discovery
- **Natural language routing**: type plain English after `@ctx` and
  the extension maps it to the correct handler
- **Auto-bootstrap**: downloads the ctx CLI binary if not found on PATH
- **Detection ring**: terminal command watcher and file edit watcher
  record governance violations for the MCP engine
- **Status bar reminders**: `$(bell) ctx` indicator for pending reminders
- **Automatic hooks**: file save, git commit, dependency change, and
  context file change handlers
- **Follow-up suggestions**: context-aware buttons after each command

### Changed

- Slash-command surface reconciled to exactly the 45 commands the
  extension dispatches. Singular commands renamed to plurals:
  `/change`→`/changes`, `/dep`→`/deps`, `/task`→`/tasks`,
  `/permission`→`/permissions`. Dedicated `/decisions` and `/learnings`
  added alongside `/add`.

### Removed

- `/loop` and `/diag` slash commands. `/site` is now reached through
  `/journal site`, and `/doctor` runs inline rather than as a top-level
  slash command.

### Configuration

- `ctx.executablePath`: path to the ctx CLI binary (default: `ctx`)
